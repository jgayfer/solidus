  <h1 class="title">Overview of products and variants</h1>

  <p class="mb-1">Products and variants are integral to Solidus. While the <code>Spree::Product</code> and <code>Spree::Variant</code> models depend on each other, it is important to understand how they are different:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>Spree::Product</code> s track the general information about a product. This includes the product description and the permalink where a customer would find the product listing on
      a store. If you sell a mug and a t-shirt, you would set up a separate product for each of them.
    </li>
    <li><code>Spree::Variant</code> s track the specific information about a variant of that product. For example, the variant provides the dimensions and weight. The variant provides the
      information required by orders and shipments. If you sell a red t-shirt and a green t-shirt, you could make each one a variant of your t-shirt product. Similarly, if all of
      your t-shirts come in small, medium, and large, then you would make additional variants for each of those: small green t-shirt, small red t-shirt, medium green t-shirt,
      medium red t-shirt, and so on.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The rest of this article introduces essential information for using products and variants in Solidus.</p>


  <h2>Products</h2>

  <p><code>Spree::Product</code> s track unique products within your store. If you sell a mug and a t-shirt, you would set up a product for each of them.</p>
  <p>If you have a number of items that are similar (like t-shirts that come in small, medium, and large sizes), you can create <a href="#">variants</a> for a single product instead of creating three separate products.</p>
  <p>You can categorize products using <a href="#">taxonomies and taxons</a>. And, if you want to offer more extensive information about a single product, you can add custom product properties for any product.</p>


  <h2>Taxonomies and taxons</h2>

  <p>Where taxons act as subcategories to taxonomies:</p>

  <div class="code-block">
    <div class="code-block-header">
      <div class="path">app/models/spree/promotion/rules/my_promotion_rule.rb</div>
      <div class="language">Ruby</div>
    </div>
    <pre><code class="language-ruby">
      module Spree
        class Promotion
          module Rules
            class MyPromotionRule < Spree::PromotionRule
              def applicable?(promotable)
                promotable.is_a?(Spree::Order)
              end

              def eligible?(order, options = {})
                ...
              end

              def actionable?(line_item)
                ...
              end
            ...
    </code></pre>
  </div>


  <h2>Example zone configuation</h2>

  <p><em>Note that the following example should not be followed for a store in production. Always speak with a tax professional before determining your tax rates and shipping fees.</em></p>
  <p>In the table below, you can see how your store could use zones in conjunction with the required tax rates and any shipping methods you wish to use:</p>

  <table class="table table-responsive-collapse">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Zone</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th class="text-md-right">Tax&nbsp;rate</th>
      <th>Available shipping methods</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td data-label="Zone"><div class="td-inner">In-state</div></td>
      <td data-label="Description"><div class="td-inner">Purchases shipped within Arizona (taxable)</div></td>
      <td data-label="Tax&nbsp;rate" class="text-md-right"><div class="td-inner">9.9%</div></td>
      <td data-label="Available shipping methods"><div class="td-inner">FedEx Express, UPS Ground, USPS First-Class</div></td>
    </tr>

      <td data-label="Tax&nbsp;rate" class="text-md-right"><div class="td-inner">0</div></td>
      <td data-label="Available shipping methods"><div class="td-inner">FedEx Express</div></td>

      <td data-label="Available shipping methods"><div class="td-inner">FedEx Express, UPS Ground</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td data-label="Description"><div class="td-inner">Purchases shipped internationally to Canada</div></td>
